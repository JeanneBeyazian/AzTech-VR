#  AzTech VR - A Virtual Rality multiplayer puzzle game inside the sacred territories of ancient civilizations

In AzTech VR, players use the power of ancient tools to solve puzzles as a team. 
By interacting with specific objects in each level, the characters of the story can move forward inside a magical environment. 
This project was completed as a coursework in UCL COMP0113 Virtual Environments (2021-22).

## Description

Players are impersonating explorers walking through some ancient mystical ruins generally themed as belonging to an antique prehispanic civilization. Throughout their journey, the characters discover a set of magical equipment and other interaction locations that will be key to solving the three-dimensional puzzles we have set up in the scene. The controls and available moves are descrived in the project report.


## Assets

We found our assets on free 3D models websites, such as SketchFab.com or we created them ourselves in Blender. The licences for imported assets are included in the Assets folder. Some of these models come from cultural institutions and are reproductions of real-life prehispanic artefacts. Notably from the National Natural History Museum of Chile (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural de Chile) or the Peru Ministry of Culture (Ministerio de Cultura Per√∫).
